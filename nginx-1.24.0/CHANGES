[21]        Thanks to Valentin Bartenev.
[22] 
[23]     *) Bugfix: incorrect location might be chosen to process a request if a
[24]        prefix location longer than 255 characters was used in the
[25]        configuration.
[26] 
[27]     *) Bugfix: non-ASCII characters in file names on Windows were not
[28]        supported by the ngx_http_autoindex_module, the ngx_http_dav_module,
[29]        and the "include" directive.
[30] 
[31]     *) Change: the logging level of the "data length too long", "length too
[32]        short", "bad legacy version", "no shared signature algorithms", "bad
[33]        digest length", "missing sigalgs extension", "encrypted length too
[34]        long", "bad length", "bad key update", "mixed handshake and non

[41]        "error_page" directive to redirect errors with code 400.
[42] 
[43]     *) Bugfix: messages about logging to syslog errors did not contain
[44]        information that the errors happened while logging to syslog.

[59]        was used to process subrequests created by other modules.
[60]        Thanks to Ciel Zhao.
[61] 
[62]     *) Workaround: when a hostname used in the "listen" directive resolves
[63]        to multiple addresses, nginx now ignores duplicates within these
[64]        addresses.
[65] 
[66]     *) Bugfix: nginx might hog CPU during unbuffered proxying if SSL
[67]        connections to backends were used.

[71] 
[72]     *) Security: processing of a specially crafted mp4 file by the
[73]        ngx_http_mp4_module might cause a worker process crash, worker
[74]        process memory disclosure, or might have potential other impact
[75]        (CVE-2022-41741, CVE-2022-41742).

[86] 
[87]     *) Change: now when using shared memory in the "ssl_session_cache"
[88]        directive the "could not allocate new session" errors are logged at
[89]        the "warn" level instead of "alert" and not more often than once per
[90]        second.
[91] 
[92]     *) Bugfix: nginx/Windows could not be built with OpenSSL 3.0.x.
[93] 
[94]     *) Bugfix: in logging of the PROXY protocol errors.

[114]        "bad cipher", and "bad ecpoint" SSL errors has been lowered from
[115]        "crit" to "info".
[116] 
[117]     *) Bugfix: while returning byte ranges nginx did not remove the
[118]        "Content-Range" header line if it was present in the original backend
[119]        response.
[120] 
[121]     *) Bugfix: a proxied response might be truncated during reconfiguration
[122]        on Linux; the bug had appeared in 1.17.5.

[126] 
[127]     *) Change in internal API: now header lines are represented as linked
[128]        lists.
[129] 
[130]     *) Change: now nginx combines arbitrary header lines with identical
[131]        names when sending to FastCGI, SCGI, and uwsgi backends, in the
[132]        $r->header_in() method of the ngx_http_perl_module, and during lookup
[133]        of the "$http_...", "$sent_http_...", "$sent_trailer_...",
[134]        "$upstream_http_...", and "$upstream_trailer_..." variables.
[135] 
[136]     *) Bugfix: if there were multiple "Vary" header lines in the backend
[137]        response, nginx only used the last of them when caching.
[138] 
[139]     *) Bugfix: if there were multiple "WWW-Authenticate" header lines in the
[140]        backend response and errors with code 401 were intercepted or the
[141]        "auth_request" directive was used, nginx only sent the first of the
[142]        header lines to the client.
[143] 
[144]     *) Change: the logging level of the "application data after close
[145]        notify" SSL errors has been lowered from "crit" to "info".
[146] 
[147]     *) Bugfix: connections might hang if nginx was built on Linux 2.6.17 or
[148]        newer, but was used on systems without EPOLLRDHUP support, notably
[149]        with epoll emulation layers; the bug had appeared in 1.17.5.
[150]        Thanks to Marcus Ball.
[151] 
[152]     *) Bugfix: nginx did not cache the response if the "Expires" response
[153]        header line disabled caching, but following "Cache-Control" header
[154]        line enabled caching.
[155] 
[156]

[185]        connections has been removed.
[186] 
[187]     *) Change: now nginx rejects SSL connections if ALPN is used by the
[188]        client, but no supported protocols can be negotiated.
[189] 
[190]     *) Change: the default value of the "sendfile_max_chunk" directive was
[191]        changed to 2 megabytes.

[210]        Thanks to Awdhesh Mathpal.
[211] 
[212]     *) Bugfix: invalid headers from backends were logged at the "info" level
[213]        instead of "error"; the bug had appeared in 1.21.1.

[246] 
[247]     *) Bugfix: the security level, which is available in OpenSSL 1.1.0 or
[248]        newer, did not affect loading of the server certificates when set
[249]        with "@SECLEVEL=N" in the "ssl_ciphers" directive.
[250] 
[251]     *) Bugfix: SSL connections with gRPC backends might hang if select,
[252]        poll, or /dev/poll methods were used.
[253] 
[254]     *) Bugfix: when using HTTP/2 client request body was always written to
[255]        disk if the "Content-Length" header line was not present in the
[256]        request.

[276]        listening sockets.
[277] 
[278]     *) Bugfix: nginx did not escape """, "<", ">", "\", "^", "`", "{", "|",
[279]        and "}" characters when proxying with changed URI.

[292] 
[293]     *) Security: 1-byte memory overwrite might occur during DNS server
[294]        response processing if the "resolver" directive was used, allowing an
[295]        attacker who is able to forge UDP packets from the DNS server to
[296]        cause worker process crash or, potentially, arbitrary code execution
[297]        (CVE-2021-23017).

[334]     *) Bugfix: nginx could not be built with the mail proxy module, but
[335]        without the ngx_mail_ssl_module; the bug had appeared in 1.19.8.
[336] 
[337]     *) Bugfix: "upstream sent response body larger than indicated content
[338]        length" errors might occur when working with gRPC backends; the bug
[339]        had appeared in 1.19.1.
[340] 
[341]     *) Bugfix: nginx might not close a connection till keepalive timeout
[342]        expiration if the connection was closed by the client while
[343]        discarding the request body.
[344] 
[345]     *) Bugfix: nginx might not detect that a connection was already closed

[380] 
[381]     *) Feature: now, if free worker connections are exhausted, nginx starts
[382]        closing not only keepalive connections, but also connections in
[383]        lingering close.
[384] 
[385]     *) Bugfix: "zero size buf in output" alerts might appear in logs if an
[386]        upstream server returned an incorrect response during unbuffered
[387]        proxying; the bug had appeared in 1.19.1.
[388] 
[389]     *) Bugfix: HEAD requests were handled incorrectly if the "return"

[817] 
[818]     *) Security: when using HTTP/2 a client might cause excessive memory
[819]        consumption (CVE-2018-16843) and CPU usage (CVE-2018-16844).
[820] 
[821]     *) Security: processing of a specially crafted mp4 file with the
[822]        ngx_http_mp4_module might result in worker process memory disclosure
[823]        (CVE-2018-16845).
[824] 
[825]     *) Feature: the "proxy_socket_keepalive", "fastcgi_socket_keepalive",
[826]        "grpc_socket_keepalive", "memcached_socket_keepalive",
[827]        "scgi_socket_keepalive", and "uwsgi_socket_keepalive" directives.
[828] 
[829]     *) Bugfix: if nginx was built with OpenSSL 1.1.0 and used with OpenSSL
[830]        1.1.1, the TLS 1.3 protocol was always enabled.
[831] 
[832]     *) Bugfix: working with gRPC backends might result in excessive memory
[833]        consumption.
[834] 
[835] 
[836] Changes with nginx 1.15.5                                        02 Oct 2018
[837]

[842] 
[843] 
[844] Changes with nginx 1.15.4                                        25 Sep 2018

[850] 
[851]     *) Bugfix: connections with some gRPC backends might not be cached when
[852]        using the "keepalive" directive.
[853] 
[854]     *) Bugfix: a socket leak might occur when using the "error_page"
[855]        directive to redirect early request processing errors, notably errors
[856]        with code 400.
[857] 
[858]     *) Bugfix: the "return" directive did not change the response code when
[859]        returning errors if the request was redirected by the "error_page"
[860]        directive.
[861] 
[862]     *) Bugfix: standard error pages and responses of the
[863]        ngx_http_autoindex_module module used the "bgcolor" attribute, and
[864]        might be displayed incorrectly when using custom color settings in
[865]        browsers.
[866]        Thanks to Nova DasSarma.
[867] 
[868]     *) Change: the logging level of the "no suitable key share" and "no
[869]        suitable signature algorithm" SSL errors has been lowered from "crit"
[870]        to "info".

[880]     *) Feature: the "keepalive_timeout" and "keepalive_requests" directives
[881]        in the "upstream" block.
[882] 
[883]     *) Bugfix: the ngx_http_dav_module did not truncate destination file
[884]        when copying a file over an existing one with the COPY method.
[885] 
[886]     *) Bugfix: the ngx_http_dav_module used zero access rights on the
[887]        destination file and did not preserve file modification time when
[888]        moving a file between different file systems with the MOVE method.
[889] 
[890]     *) Bugfix: the ngx_http_dav_module used default access rights when
[891]        copying a file with the COPY method.
[892] 
[893]     *) Workaround: some clients might not work when using HTTP/2; the bug
[894]        had appeared in 1.13.5.

[902]        ngx_stream_ssl_preread_module.
[903] 
[904]     *) Feature: now when using the "reset_timedout_connection" directive
[905]        nginx will reset connections being closed with the 444 code.
[906] 
[907]     *) Change: a logging level of the "http request", "https proxy request",
[908]        "unsupported protocol", and "version too low" SSL errors has been
[909]        lowered from "crit" to "info".
[910] 
[911]     *) Bugfix: DNS requests were not resent if initial sending of a request
[912]        failed.
[913] 
[914]     *) Bugfix: the "reuseport" parameter of the "listen" directive was
[915]        ignored if the number of worker processes was specified after the
[916]        "listen" directive.
[917] 
[918]     *) Bugfix: when using OpenSSL 1.1.0 or newer it was not possible to
[919]        switch off "ssl_prefer_server_ciphers" in a virtual server if it was
[920]        switched on in the default server.
[921] 
[922]     *) Bugfix: SSL session reuse with upstream servers did not work with the
[923]        TLS 1.3 protocol.

[927] 
[928]     *) Feature: the "random" directive inside the "upstream" block.
[929] 
[930]     *) Feature: improved performance when using the "hash" and "ip_hash"
[931]        directives with the "zone" directive.
[932] 
[933]     *) Feature: the "reuseport" parameter of the "listen" directive now uses
[934]        SO_REUSEPORT_LB on FreeBSD 12.
[935] 
[936]     *) Bugfix: HTTP/2 server push did not work if SSL was terminated by a
[937]        proxy server in front of nginx.
[938] 
[939]     *) Bugfix: the "tcp_nopush" directive was always used on backend
[940]        connections.
[941] 
[942]     *) Bugfix: sending a disk-buffered request body to a gRPC backend might
[943]        fail.

[947] 
[948]     *) Change: the "ssl" directive is deprecated; the "ssl" parameter of the
[949]        "listen" directive should be used instead.
[950] 
[951]     *) Change: now nginx detects missing SSL certificates during
[952]        configuration testing when using the "ssl" parameter of the "listen"
[953]        directive.
[954] 
[955]     *) Feature: now the stream module can handle multiple incoming UDP
[956]        datagrams from a client within a single session.
[957] 
[958]     *) Bugfix: it was possible to specify an incorrect response code in the
[959]        "proxy_cache_valid" directive.
[960]

[1002] 
[1003]     *) Feature: the "set" parameter of the "include" SSI directive now
[1004]        allows writing arbitrary responses to a variable; the
[1005]        "subrequest_output_buffer_size" directive defines maximum response
[1006]        size.
[1007] 
[1008]     *) Feature: now nginx uses clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC) if available,
[1009]        to avoid timeouts being incorrectly triggered on system time changes.

[1024] 
[1025] 
[1026] Changes with nginx 1.13.9                                        20 Feb 2018

[1045]     *) Feature: now nginx automatically preserves the CAP_NET_RAW capability
[1046]        in worker processes when using the "transparent" parameter of the
[1047]        "proxy_bind", "fastcgi_bind", "memcached_bind", "scgi_bind", and

[1069] 
[1070]     *) Bugfix: in the "proxy_cache_background_update" directive.
[1071] 
[1072]     *) Bugfix: it was not possible to start a parameter with a variable in

[1428]        format are available in the $ssl_client_s_dn_legacy and
[1429]        $ssl_client_i_dn_legacy variables.
[1430] 
[1431]     *) Change: when storing temporary files in a cache directory they will

[1554] 
[1555]     *) Change: now nginx always uses internal MD5 and SHA1 implementations;
[1556]        the --with-md5 and --with-sha1 configure options were canceled.
[1557] 
[1558]     *) Feature: variables support in the stream module.
[1559] 
[1560]     *) Feature: the ngx_stream_map_module.
[1561] 
[1562]     *) Feature: the ngx_stream_return_module.
[1563] 
[1564]     *) Feature: a port can be specified in the "proxy_bind", "fastcgi_bind",
[1565]        "memcached_bind", "scgi_bind", and "uwsgi_bind" directives.
[1566] 
[1567]     *) Feature: now nginx uses the IP_BIND_ADDRESS_NO_PORT socket option
[1568]        when available.
[1569] 
[1570]     *) Bugfix: a segmentation fault might occur in a worker process when
[1571]        using HTTP/2 and the "proxy_request_buffering" directive.
[1572] 
[1573]     *) Bugfix: the "Content-Length" request header line was always added to
[1574]        requests passed to backends, including requests without body, when
[1575]        using HTTP/2.
[1576] 
[1577]     *) Bugfix: "http request count is zero" alerts might appear in logs when
[1578]        using HTTP/2.
[1579] 
[1580]     *) Bugfix: unnecessary buffering might occur when using the "sub_filter"
[1581]        directive; the issue had appeared in 1.9.4.
[1582] 
[1583] 
[1584] Changes with nginx 1.11.1                                        31 May 2016
[1585] 
[1586]     *) Security: a segmentation fault might occur in a worker process while
[1587]        writing a specially crafted request body to a temporary file
[1588]        (CVE-2016-4450); the bug had appeared in 1.3.9.
[1589] 
[1590] 
[1591] Changes with nginx 1.11.0                                        24 May 2016
[1592] 
[1593]     *) Feature: the "transparent" parameter of the "proxy_bind",
[1594]        "fastcgi_bind", "memcached_bind", "scgi_bind", and "uwsgi_bind"
[1595]        directives.
[1596] 
[1597]     *) Feature: the $request_id variable.
[1598] 
[1599]     *) Feature: the "map" directive supports combinations of multiple
[1600]        variables as resulting values.
[1601] 
[1602]     *) Feature: now nginx checks if EPOLLRDHUP events are supported by
[1603]        kernel, and optimizes connection handling accordingly if the "epoll"
[1604]        method is used.
[1605] 
[1606]     *) Feature: the "ssl_certificate" and "ssl_certificate_key" directives
[1607]        can be specified multiple times to load certificates of different
[1608]        types (for example, RSA and ECDSA).
[1609] 
[1610]     *) Feature: the "ssl_ecdh_curve" directive now allows specifying a list
[1611]        of curves when using OpenSSL 1.0.2 or newer; by default a list built
[1612]        into OpenSSL is used.
[1613] 
[1614]     *) Change: to use DHE ciphers it is now required to specify parameters
[1615]        using the "ssl_dhparam" directive.
[1616] 
[1617]     *) Feature: the $proxy_protocol_port variable.
[1618] 
[1619]     *) Feature: the $realip_remote_port variable in the
[1620]        ngx_http_realip_module.
[1621] 
[1622]     *) Feature: the ngx_http_realip_module is now able to set the client
[1623]        port in addition to the address.
[1624] 
[1625]     *) Change: the "421 Misdirected Request" response now used when
[1626]        rejecting requests to a virtual server different from one negotiated
[1627]        during an SSL handshake; this improves interoperability with some
[1628]        HTTP/2 clients when using client certificates.
[1629] 
[1630]     *) Change: HTTP/2 clients can now start sending request body
[1631]        immediately; the "http2_body_preread_size" directive controls size of
[1632]        the buffer used before nginx will start reading client request body.
[1633] 
[1634]     *) Bugfix: cached error responses were not updated when using the
[1635]        "proxy_cache_bypass" directive.
[1636] 
[1637] 
[1638] Changes with nginx 1.9.15                                        19 Apr 2016
[1639] 
[1640]     *) Bugfix: "recv() failed" errors might occur when using HHVM as a
[1641]        FastCGI server.
[1642] 
[1643]     *) Bugfix: when using HTTP/2 and the "limit_req" or "auth_request"
[1644]        directives a timeout or a "client violated flow control" error might
[1645]        occur while reading client request body; the bug had appeared in
[1646]        1.9.14.
[1647] 
[1648]     *) Workaround: a response might not be shown by some browsers if HTTP/2
[1649]        was used and client request body was not fully read; the bug had
[1650]        appeared in 1.9.14.
[1651] 
[1652]     *) Bugfix: connections might hang when using the "aio threads"
[1653]        directive.
[1654]        Thanks to Mindaugas Rasiukevicius.
[1655] 
[1656] 
[1657] Changes with nginx 1.9.14                                        05 Apr 2016
[1658] 
[1659]     *) Feature: OpenSSL 1.1.0 compatibility.
[1660] 
[1661]     *) Feature: the "proxy_request_buffering", "fastcgi_request_buffering",
[1662]        "scgi_request_buffering", and "uwsgi_request_buffering" directives
[1663]        now work with HTTP/2.
[1664] 
[1665]     *) Bugfix: "zero size buf in output" alerts might appear in logs when
[1666]        using HTTP/2.
[1667] 
[1668]     *) Bugfix: the "client_max_body_size" directive might work incorrectly
[1669]        when using HTTP/2.
[1670] 
[1671]     *) Bugfix: of minor bugs in logging.
[1672] 
[1673] 
[1674] Changes with nginx 1.9.13                                        29 Mar 2016
[1675] 
[1676]     *) Change: non-idempotent requests (POST, LOCK, PATCH) are no longer
[1677]        passed to the next server by default if a request has been sent to a
[1678]        backend; the "non_idempotent" parameter of the "proxy_next_upstream"
[1679]        directive explicitly allows retrying such requests.
[1680] 
[1681]     *) Feature: the ngx_http_perl_module can be built dynamically.
[1682] 
[1683]     *) Feature: UDP support in the stream module.
[1684] 
[1685]     *) Feature: the "aio_write" directive.
[1686] 
[1687]     *) Feature: now cache manager monitors number of elements in caches and
[1688]        tries to avoid cache keys zone overflows.
[1689] 
[1690]     *) Bugfix: "task already active" and "second aio post" alerts might
[1691]        appear in logs when using the "sendfile" and "aio" directives with
[1692]        subrequests.
[1693] 
[1694]     *) Bugfix: "zero size buf in output" alerts might appear in logs if
[1695]        caching was used and a client closed a connection prematurely.
[1696] 
[1697]     *) Bugfix: connections with clients might be closed needlessly if
[1698]        caching was used.
[1699]        Thanks to Justin Li.
[1700] 
[1701]     *) Bugfix: nginx might hog CPU if the "sendfile" directive was used on
[1702]        Linux or Solaris and a file being sent was changed during sending.
[1703] 
[1704]     *) Bugfix: connections might hang when using the "sendfile" and "aio
[1705]        threads" directives.
[1706] 
[1707]     *) Bugfix: in the "proxy_pass", "fastcgi_pass", "scgi_pass", and
[1708]        "uwsgi_pass" directives when using variables.
[1709]        Thanks to Piotr Sikora.
[1710] 
[1711]     *) Bugfix: in the ngx_http_sub_filter_module.
[1712] 
[1713]     *) Bugfix: if an error occurred in a cached backend connection, the
[1714]        request was passed to the next server regardless of the
[1715]        proxy_next_upstream directive.
[1716] 
[1717]     *) Bugfix: "CreateFile() failed" errors when creating temporary files on
[1718]        Windows.
[1719] 
[1720] 
[1721] Changes with nginx 1.9.12                                        24 Feb 2016
[1722] 
[1723]     *) Feature: Huffman encoding of response headers in HTTP/2.
[1724]        Thanks to Vlad Krasnov.
[1725] 
[1726]     *) Feature: the "worker_cpu_affinity" directive now supports more than
[1727]        64 CPUs.
[1728] 
[1729]     *) Bugfix: compatibility with 3rd party C++ modules; the bug had
[1730]        appeared in 1.9.11.
[1731]        Thanks to Piotr Sikora.
[1732] 
[1733]     *) Bugfix: nginx could not be built statically with OpenSSL on Linux;
[1734]        the bug had appeared in 1.9.11.
[1735] 
[1736]     *) Bugfix: the "add_header ... always" directive with an empty value did
[1737]        not delete "Last-Modified" and "ETag" header lines from error
[1738]        responses.
[1739] 
[1740]     *) Workaround: "called a function you should not call" and "shutdown
[1741]        while in init" messages might appear in logs when using OpenSSL
[1742]        1.0.2f.
[1743] 
[1744]     *) Bugfix: invalid headers might be logged incorrectly.
[1745] 
[1746]     *) Bugfix: socket leak when using HTTP/2.
[1747] 
[1748]     *) Bugfix: in the ngx_http_v2_module.
[1749] 
[1750] 
[1751] Changes with nginx 1.9.11                                        09 Feb 2016

[1761] 
[1762] 
[1763] Changes with nginx 1.9.10                                        26 Jan 2016
[1764] 
[1765]     *) Security: invalid pointer dereference might occur during DNS server
[1766]        response processing if the "resolver" directive was used, allowing an
[1767]        attacker who is able to forge UDP packets from the DNS server to
[1768]        cause segmentation fault in a worker process (CVE-2016-0742).
[1769] 
[1770]     *) Security: use-after-free condition might occur during CNAME response
[1771]        processing if the "resolver" directive was used, allowing an attacker
[1772]        who is able to trigger name resolution to cause segmentation fault in
[1773]        a worker process, or might have potential other impact
[1774]        (CVE-2016-0746).
[1775] 
[1776]     *) Security: CNAME resolution was insufficiently limited if the
[1777]        "resolver" directive was used, allowing an attacker who is able to
[1778]        trigger arbitrary name resolution to cause excessive resource
[1779]        consumption in worker processes (CVE-2016-0747).
[1780] 
[1781]     *) Feature: the "auto" parameter of the "worker_cpu_affinity" directive.
[1782] 
[1783]     *) Bugfix: the "proxy_protocol" parameter of the "listen" directive did
[1784]        not work with IPv6 listen sockets.
[1785]

[1787]        when using the "keepalive" directive.
[1788] 
[1789]     *) Bugfix: proxying used the HTTP method of the original request after
[1790]        an "X-Accel-Redirect" redirection.
[1791] 
[1792] 
[1793] Changes with nginx 1.9.9                                         09 Dec 2015
[1794] 
[1795]     *) Bugfix: proxying to unix domain sockets did not work when using
[1796]        variables; the bug had appeared in 1.9.8.
[1797] 
[1798] 
[1799] Changes with nginx 1.9.8                                         08 Dec 2015

[1804] 
[1805]     *) Feature: the ngx_http_slice_module.
[1806] 
[1807]     *) Bugfix: a segmentation fault might occur in a worker process when
[1808]        using LibreSSL; the bug had appeared in 1.9.6.
[1809] 
[1810]     *) Bugfix: nginx could not be built on OS X in some cases.
[1811] 
[1812] 
[1813] Changes with nginx 1.9.7                                         17 Nov 2015
[1814] 
[1815]     *) Feature: the "nohostname" parameter of logging to syslog.
[1816] 
[1817]     *) Feature: the "proxy_cache_convert_head" directive.
[1818] 
[1819]     *) Feature: the $realip_remote_addr variable in the
[1820]        ngx_http_realip_module.
[1821] 
[1822]     *) Bugfix: the "expires" directive might not work when using variables.
[1823] 
[1824]     *) Bugfix: a segmentation fault might occur in a worker process when
[1825]        using HTTP/2; the bug had appeared in 1.9.6.
[1826] 
[1827]     *) Bugfix: if nginx was built with the ngx_http_v2_module it was
[1828]        possible to use the HTTP/2 protocol even if the "http2" parameter of
[1829]        the "listen" directive was not specified.
[1830] 
[1831]     *) Bugfix: in the ngx_http_v2_module.
[1832] 
[1833] 
[1834] Changes with nginx 1.9.6                                         27 Oct 2015
[1835] 
[1836]     *) Bugfix: a segmentation fault might occur in a worker process when

[1840]     *) Bugfix: the $server_protocol variable was empty when using HTTP/2.
[1841] 
[1842]     *) Bugfix: backend SSL connections in the stream module might be timed
[1843]        out unexpectedly.
[1844] 
[1845]     *) Bugfix: a segmentation fault might occur in a worker process if
[1846]        different ssl_session_cache settings were used in different virtual
[1847]        servers.
[1848] 
[1849]     *) Bugfix: nginx/Windows could not be built with MinGW gcc; the bug had
[1850]        appeared in 1.9.4.
[1851]        Thanks to Kouhei Sutou.
[1852] 
[1853]     *) Bugfix: time was not updated when the timer_resolution directive was
[1854]        used on Windows.

[1861] 
[1862]     *) Feature: the ngx_http_v2_module (replaces ngx_http_spdy_module).
[1863]        Thanks to Dropbox and Automattic for sponsoring this work.
[1864] 
[1865]     *) Change: now the "output_buffers" directive uses two buffers by
[1866]        default.
[1867] 
[1868]     *) Change: now nginx limits subrequests recursion, not simultaneous
[1869]        subrequests.
[1870] 
[1871]     *) Change: now nginx checks the whole cache key when returning a
[1872]        response from cache.
[1873]        Thanks to Gena Makhomed and Sergey Brester.
[1874] 
[1875]     *) Bugfix: "header already sent" alerts might appear in logs when using
[1876]        cache; the bug had appeared in 1.7.5.
[1877] 
[1878]     *) Bugfix: "writev() failed (4: Interrupted system call)" errors might
[1879]        appear in logs when using CephFS and the "timer_resolution" directive
[1880]        on Linux.
[1881] 
[1882]     *) Bugfix: in invalid configurations handling.
[1883]        Thanks to Markus Linnala.
[1884] 
[1885]     *) Bugfix: a segmentation fault occurred in a worker process if the
[1886]        "sub_filter" directive was used at http level; the bug had appeared
[1887]        in 1.9.4.
[1888] 
[1889] 
[1890] Changes with nginx 1.9.4                                         18 Aug 2015
[1891] 
[1892]     *) Change: the "proxy_downstream_buffer" and "proxy_upstream_buffer"
[1893]        directives of the stream module are replaced with the
[1894]        "proxy_buffer_size" directive.
[1895] 
[1896]     *) Feature: the "tcp_nodelay" directive in the stream module.
[1897] 
[1898]     *) Feature: multiple "sub_filter" directives can be used simultaneously.

[1904]        Thanks to Gena Makhomed.
[1905] 
[1906]     *) Bugfix: old worker processes might hog CPU after reconfiguration with
[1907]        a large number of worker_connections.
[1908] 
[1909]     *) Bugfix: a segmentation fault might occur in a worker process if the
[1910]        "try_files" and "alias" directives were used inside a location given
[1911]        by a regular expression; the bug had appeared in 1.7.1.
[1912] 
[1913]     *) Bugfix: the "try_files" directive inside a nested location given by a
[1914]        regular expression worked incorrectly if the "alias" directive was
[1915]        used in the outer location.
[1916]

[2186]        if the "postpone_output 0" directive was used with SSI includes.

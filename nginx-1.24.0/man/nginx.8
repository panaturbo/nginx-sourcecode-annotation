[42] .Sh DESCRIPTION
[43] .Nm
[44] (pronounced
[45] .Dq engine x )
[46] is an HTTP and reverse proxy server, a mail proxy server, and a generic
[47] TCP/UDP proxy server.
[48] It is known for its high performance, stability, rich feature set, simple
[49] configuration, and low resource consumption.
[50] .Pp
[51] The options are as follows:
[52] .Bl -tag -width ".Fl d Ar directives"
[53] .It Fl ?\& , h
[54] Print help.
[55] .It Fl c Ar file
[56] Use an alternative configuration
[57] .Ar file .
[58] .It Fl e Ar file
[59] Use an alternative error log
[60] .Ar file .
[61] Special value
[62] .Cm stderr
[63] indicates that the standard error output should be used.
[64] .It Fl g Ar directives
[65] Set global configuration directives.
[66] See
[67] .Sx EXAMPLES
[68] for details.
[69] .It Fl p Ar prefix
[70] Set the prefix path.
[71] The default value is
[72] .Pa %%PREFIX%% .
[73] .It Fl q
[74] Suppress non-error messages during configuration testing.
[75] .It Fl s Ar signal
[76] Send a signal to the master process.
[77] The argument
[78] .Ar signal
[79] can be one of:
[80] .Cm stop , quit , reopen , reload .
[81] The following table shows the corresponding system signals:
[82] .Pp
[83] .Bl -tag -width ".Cm reopen" -compact
[84] .It Cm stop
[85] .Dv SIGTERM
[86] .It Cm quit
[87] .Dv SIGQUIT
[88] .It Cm reopen
[89] .Dv SIGUSR1
[90] .It Cm reload
[91] .Dv SIGHUP
[92] .El
[93] .It Fl T
[94] Same as
[95] .Fl t ,
[96] but additionally dump configuration files to standard output.
[97] .It Fl t
[98] Do not run, just test the configuration file.
[99] .Nm
[100] checks the configuration file syntax and then tries to open files
[101] referenced in the configuration file.
[102] .It Fl V
[103] Print the
[104] .Nm
[105] version, compiler version, and
[106] .Pa configure
[107] script parameters.
[108] .It Fl v
[109] Print the
[110] .Nm
[111] version.
[112] .El
[113] .Sh SIGNALS
[114] The master process of
[115] .Nm
[116] can handle the following signals:
[117] .Pp
[118] .Bl -tag -width ".Dv SIGINT , SIGTERM" -compact
[119] .It Dv SIGINT , SIGTERM
[120] Shut down quickly.
[121] .It Dv SIGHUP
[122] Reload configuration, start the new worker process with a new
[123] configuration, and gracefully shut down old worker processes.
[124] .It Dv SIGQUIT
[125] Shut down gracefully.
[126] .It Dv SIGUSR1
[127] Reopen log files.
[128] .It Dv SIGUSR2
[129] Upgrade the

[131] executable on the fly.
[132] .It Dv SIGWINCH
[133] Shut down worker processes gracefully.
[134] .El
[135] .Pp
[136] While there is no need to explicitly control worker processes normally,
[137] they support some signals too:
[138] .Pp
[139] .Bl -tag -width ".Dv SIGINT , SIGTERM" -compact
[140] .It Dv SIGTERM
[141] Shut down quickly.
[142] .It Dv SIGQUIT
[143] Shut down gracefully.
[144] .It Dv SIGUSR1
[145] Reopen log files.
[146] .El
[147] .Sh DEBUGGING LOG
[148] To enable a debugging log, reconfigure
[149] .Nm
[150] to build with debugging:
[151] .Pp
[152] .Dl "./configure --with-debug ..."
[153] .Pp
[154] and then set the
[155] .Cm debug
[156] level of the
[157] .Va error_log :
[158] .Pp
[159] .Dl "error_log /path/to/log debug;"
[160] .Pp
[161] It is also possible to enable the debugging for a particular IP address:
[162] .Bd -literal -offset indent
[163] events {
[164] 	debug_connection 127.0.0.1;
[165] }
[166] .Ed
[167] .Sh ENVIRONMENT
[168] The
[169] .Ev NGINX
[170] environment variable is used internally by
[171] .Nm
[172] and should not be set directly by the user.
[173] .Sh FILES
[174] .Bl -tag -width indent
[175] .It Pa %%PID_PATH%%
[176] Contains the process ID of
[177] .Nm .
[178] The contents of this file are not sensitive, so it can be world-readable.
[179] .It Pa %%CONF_PATH%%
[180] The main configuration file.
[181] .It Pa %%ERROR_LOG_PATH%%
[182] Error log file.
[183] .El

[186] .Sh EXAMPLES
[187] Test configuration file
[188] .Pa ~/mynginx.conf
[189] with global directives for PID and quantity of worker processes:
[190] .Bd -literal -offset indent
[191] nginx -t -c ~/mynginx.conf \e
[192] 	-g "pid /var/run/mynginx.pid; worker_processes 2;"
